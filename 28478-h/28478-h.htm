<h3>BOOKS CHAINED TO DESKS IN CHURCHES: FONT INSCRIPTION: PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES.</h3>

  <p>It would be interesting to have a complete list of the various books
  still to be found chained to desks in our ancient churches. The "Bible of
  the largest volume," the "Books of Homilies allowed by authority," and
  the Book of Common Prayer, are ordered by Canon 80. to be provided for
  every church. In some places this regulation is still complied with: at
  Oakington, Cambridgeshire, a copy of a recent (1825) edition of the
  Homilies lies on a small desk in the nave. But besides these
  authoritative works, other books are found <i>chained</i> to their
  ancient desks: at Impington, Cambridgeshire are, or were, "three
  black-letter volumes of Fox's <i>Martyrs</i> chained to a stall in the
  chancel." (Paley's <i>Ecclesiologist's Guide, &amp;c.</i>) At St.
  Nicholas, Rochester, chained to a small bracket desk at the south side of
  the west door, is a copy of <i>A Collection of Cases and other Discourses
  to recover Dissenters to the Church of England</i>, small 8vo., 1718. The
  <i>Paraphrase</i> of Erasmus may probably be added to the list (see
  Professor Blunt's <i>Sketch of the History of the Reformation</i>, 10th
  edit., p. 130.), though I cannot call to mind any church in which a copy
  of this work may now be found. In the noble minster church at Wimborne,
  Dorsetshire, is a rather large collection of books, comprising some old
  and valuable editions: all these books were, and many still are, chained
  to their shelves; an iron rod runs along the front of each shelf, on
  which rings attached to the chains fastened to the covers of the works
  have free play; these volumes are preserved in an upper chamber on the
  south side of the chancel. The parochial library at St. Margaret's, Lynn,
  Norfolk, is one of considerable interest and importance; amongst other
  treasures are a curious little manuscript of the New Testament very
  neatly written, a (mutilated) black-letter copy of the <i>Sarum
  Missal</i>, and many fine copies of the works of the Fathers, and also of
  the Reformers; these are preserved in the south aisle of the chancel,
  which is fitted up as a library, and are in very good order. At Margate
  Church are a few volumes, of what kind my note-book does <!-- Page 94
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>not inform me. I
  may also mention, in connexion with St. Nicholas, Rochester, that the
  font is octagonal, and inscribed with the following capital letters, the
  first surmounted by a crown:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>C . R . I . * . * . * . A . N.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The large panel on each side contains one of the letters; the font is
  placed close to the wall, so that the remaining letters, indicated by
  asterisks, cannot now be read: the sexton said that the whole word was
  supposed to be "Christian," or rather "Cristian." Beside the font is a
  very quaint iron bracket-stand, painted blue and gold, "constructed to
  carry" two candles.</p>

<h3>REAL SIGNATURES VERSUS PSEUDO-NAMES.</h3>

  <p>It is pleasant to see so many of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q."
  joining in the remonstrance against the anonymous system. Were one to set
  about accumulating the reasons for the abandonment of pseudo-names and
  initials, many of the valuable columns of this periodical might be easily
  filled; such an essay it is not, however, my intention to inflict on its
  readers, who by a little thought can easily do for themselves more than a
  large effusion of ink on the part of any correspondent could effect. I
  shall content myself with recounting the good which, in one instance, has
  resulted from a knowledge of the real name and address of a
  contributor.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Rev. H. T. Ellacombe</span> (one of the first to
  raise his voice against the use of pseudo-names) having observed in "N.
  &amp; Q." many communications evincing no ordinary acquaintance with the
  national Records of Ireland, and wishing to enter into direct
  communication with the writer (who merely signed himself J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;F.), put a
  Query in the "Notices to Correspondents," begging J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;F. to communicate
  his real name and address. There in all probability the matter would have
  ended, as J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;F. did not happen to take "N. &amp; Q.," but that the
  writer of these lines chanced to be aware, that under the above given
  initials lurked the name of the worthy, the courteous, the erudite, and,
  yet more strange still, the <i>unpaid</i> guardian of the Irish Exchequer
  Records&mdash;James Frederick Ferguson,&mdash;a name which many a student
  of Irish history will recognise with warm gratitude and unfeigned
  respect. Now it had so happened that by a strange fortune <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span> was the repository of information as to
  the whereabouts of certain of the ancient Records of Ireland (see <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe's</span> notice of the matter, Vol. viii., p.
  5.), abstracted at some former period from the "legal custody" of some
  heedless keeper, and sold by a Jew to a German gentleman, and the result
  of his communicating this knowledge to Mr. Ferguson, has been the latter
  gentleman's "chivalrous" and successful expedition for their recovery.
  The <i>English Quarterly Review</i> (not <i>Magazine</i>, as <span
  class="sc">Mr. Ellacombe</span> inadvertently writes), in a forthcoming
  article on the Records of Ireland, will, it is to be hoped, give the full
  details of this exciting record hunt, and thus exemplify the <i>great
  utility</i>, not to speak of the <i>manliness</i>, of real names and
  addresses, <i>versus</i> false names and equally Will-o'-the-Wisp
  initials.</p>

<h3>POPULAR STORIES OF THE ENGLISH PEASANTRY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. v., p. 363. &amp;c.)</p>

  <p>Will you allow me, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," to say how
  much obliged I should be for any communications on this subject. Since I
  last addressed you (about a year ago) I have received many interesting
  contributions towards my proposed collection; but not, I regret to say,
  quite to the extent I had anticipated. My own researches have been
  principally confined to the midland counties, and I have very little from
  the north or east. Such a large field requires many gleaners, and I hope
  your correspondents learned in Folklore will not be backward in lending
  their aid to complete a work which Scott, Southey, and a host of
  illustrious names, have considered a desideratum in our national
  antiquities.</p>

  <p>I propose to divide the tales into three classes&mdash;Mythological,
  Humorous, and Nurse-tales. Of the mythological I have already given
  several specimens in your journal, but I will give the following, as it
  illustrates another link in the transmission of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Keightley's</span> Hindustani legend, which appeared in a recent Number.
  It is from Northamptonshire.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>The Bogie and the Farmer.</i></p>

  <p>Once upon a time a Bogie asserted a claim to a field which had been
  hitherto in the possession of a farmer; and after a great deal of
  disputing, they came to an arrangement by agreeing to divide its produce
  between them. At seed time, the farmer asks the Bogie what part of the
  crop he will have, "tops or bottoms." "Bottoms," said the spirit: upon
  which the crafty farmer sows the field with wheat, so that when harvest
  arrives the corn falls to his share, while the poor Bogie is obliged to
  content himself with the stubble. Next year the spirit, finding he had
  made such an unfortunate selection in the bottoms, chose the tops;
  whereupon cunning Hodge set the field with turnips, thus again outwitting
  the simple <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span>claimant. Tired of this unprofitable
  farming, the Bogie agrees to hazard his claims on a mowing-match,
  thinking that his supernatural strength would give him an easy victory;
  but before the day of meeting, the cunning earth-tiller procures a number
  of iron bars which he stows among the grass to be mown by his opponent;
  and when the trial commences, the unsuspecting goblin finds his progress
  retarded by his scythe coming into contact with these obstacles, which he
  takes to be some very hard&mdash;very hard&mdash;species of dock. "Mortal
  hard docks, these," said he; "Nation hard docks!" His blunted scythe soon
  brings him to a stand still, and as, in such cases, it is not allowed for
  one to sharpen without the other, he turns to his antagonist, now far
  ahead, and inquires, in a tone of despair, "When d'ye wiffle-waffle
  (whet), mate?" "Waffle!" said the farmer, with a well-feigned stare of
  amazement, "O, about noon mebby." "Then," said the despairing spirit,
  "That thief of a Christian has done me;" and so saying, he disappeared
  and was never heard of more.</p>

  <p>Under <i>Nurse-tales</i>, I include the extremely puerile stories of
  the nursery, often (as in the German ones) interlaced with rhymes. The
  following, from the banks of the Avon, sounds like an echo from a German
  story-book.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Little Elly.</i></p>

  <p>In the old time, a certain good king laid all the ghosts, and hanged
  all the witches and wizards save one, who fell into a bad way, and kept a
  school in a small village. One day Little Elly looked through a
  chink-hole, and saw him eating man's flesh and drinking man's blood; but
  Little Elly kept it all to herself, and went to school as before. And
  when school was over the Ogee fixed his eyes upon her, and
  said&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All go home but Elly,</p>
      <p>And Elly come to me."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And when they were gone he said, "What did you see me eat, Elly?"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O something did I see,</p>
      <p>But nothing will I tell,</p>
      <p>Unto my dying day."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And so he pulled off her shoes, and whipped her till she bled (this
  repeated three days); and the third day he took her up, and put her into
  a rose-bush, where the rain rained, and the snow snowed, and the hail
  hailed, and the wind blew upon her all night. Quickly her tiny spirit
  crept out of her tiny body and hovered round the bed of her parents,
  where it sung in mournful voice for evermore&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Dark, weary, and cold am I,</p>
      <p>Little knoweth Gammie where am I."</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>The old Corrector on "The Winter's Tale."</i>&mdash;I am glad to
  find that you have another correspondent, and a very able one too, under
  the signature of A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B., who takes the same view of "Aristotle's
  checks" as I have done; though I think he might have paid me the
  compliment of <i>just</i> noticing my prior remonstrance on this subject.
  It is to be lamented, that <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> should
  have hurried out his new edition of Shakspeare, adopting all the sweeping
  <i>emendations</i> of his newly-found commentator, without paying the
  slightest heed to any of the suggestions which have been offered to him
  in a friendly spirit, or affording time for the farther objections which
  are continually pouring in. At the risk of probably wearying some of your
  readers, I cannot forbear submitting to you a few more remarks; but I
  shall confine them on this occasion to one play, <i>The Winter's
  Tale</i>: which contains, perhaps, as many poetical beauties as any
  single work of our great dramatic bard. With reference to the passage
  quoted in p. 437., I can hardly believe that Shakspeare ever wrote such a
  poor unmeaning line as&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; they are false as <i>dead blacks</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>nor can I perceive any possible objection to the original words "o'er
  dyed blacks." They may either mean false mourners, putting an <i>over</i>
  dark semblance of grief; or they may allude figuratively to the material
  of mourning, the colours of which if <i>over-dyed</i> will not stand. In
  either of these senses, the passage is poetical; but there is nothing
  like poetry in "<i>our dead blacks</i>."</p>

  <p>In p. 450. the alteration of the word "and" to "heaven" may be right,
  though it is difficult to conceive how the one can have been mistaken for
  the other. At all events, the sense is improved by the change; but I do
  not see that anything is gained by the substitution in the next line of
  "dream" for "theme." Whatever the king said in his ravings about
  Hermione, might as aptly be called part of his "theme" as part of his
  "dream." The subject of his <i>dream</i> was in fact his
  <i>theme</i>!</p>

  <p>Neither can I discover any good reason for changing, in p. 452.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; and one may drink, depart,</p>
      <p>And yet partake no venom,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>into "drink a part." The context clearly shows the author's meaning to
  have been, that if any one <i>departed</i> at once after tasting of the
  beverage, he would have no knowledge of what he had drunk; <!-- Page 96
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>but if he
  remained, some one present might point out to him the spider in the cup,
  and <i>then</i> "he cracks his gorge," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In p. 460. <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> says that the passage,
  "dangerous, unsafe lunes i' the king," is mere tautology, and
  <i>therefore</i> he follows the old corrector in substituting "<i>unsane
  lunes</i>." Now it strikes me that there is quite as much
  <i>tautology</i> in "<i>unsane lunes</i>" as in the double epithet,
  "dangerous, unsafe." It is, in fact, equivalent to "insane madness;" and,
  moreover, drags in quite needlessly a very unusual and uncouth word.</p>

  <p>In p. 481. we have the last word of the following passage&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</p>
      <p>So fill'd and so becoming,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>converted into "<i>o'er-running</i>." This may possibly be the correct
  reading; but, seeing that it is immediately followed by the
  words&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; in pure white robes,</p>
      <p>Like very sanctity,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I question whether "becoming" is not the more natural expression.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There weep&mdash;and leave it crying,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>is made&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"There <i>wend</i>&mdash;and leave it crying,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which I submit is decidedly wrong. I will not be hypercritical, or I
  might suggest that in that case the words would have been "<i>thither</i>
  wend;" but I maintain that the change is contrary to the <i>sense</i>.
  The spirit of Hermione never could have been intended to say that the
  <i>child</i> should be left <i>crying</i>. She would rather wish that it
  might <i>not cry</i>! The meaning, as it seems to me, is, that Antigonus
  should <i>weep</i> over the babe, and leave it while so
  <i>weeping</i>.</p>

  <p>In p. 487. the words "missingly noted" are altered to "<i>musingly</i>
  noted," which is a very questionable improvement. Camillo, <i>missing</i>
  Florigel from court, would naturally <i>note</i> his absence; and he may
  have <i>mused</i> over the causes of it, but there could be no necessity
  for <i>musing</i> to note the fact of his absence: and I cannot help
  thinking that the word <i>missingly</i> is more in Shakspeare's
  style.</p>

  <p>I cannot subscribe at all to the alteration in p. 492. of the word
  "unrolled" to "enrolled." To be enrolled <i>and placed</i> in the book of
  virtue is very like tautology; but I conceive Shakspeare meant Autolycus
  to wish that his name might be <i>unrolled</i> from the company of
  thieves and gypsies with whom he was associated, and transferred to the
  book of virtue.</p>

  <p>I am entirely at issue with the old corrector upon his
  <i>emendation</i> in p. 498.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; Nothing she does or <i>seems</i>,</p>
      <p>But smacks of something greater than herself;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>he says, ought to be: "Nothing she does or <i>says</i>." And how does
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> explain this misprint? Why, by
  stating that formerly "says" was often written "saies." Now, I cannot for
  the life of me discover why the word "saies" should have been mistaken
  for "seems," any more than the word "says." But surely the phrase,
  "nothing she does or seems," is far more poetical and elegant than the
  other. It says in effect: there is nothing either in her acts or her
  carriage, "but smacks of something greater than herself." We have
  positive evidence, however, that the passage could not have been "nothing
  she does or says," viz. that this speech of Polixenes immediately follows
  a long dialogue between Florizel and Perdita, which could not have been
  overheard, because Camillo directly afterwards says to the king:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; He tells her something,</p>
      <p>That makes her blood look out."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thereby clearly proving, that the king could not have been remarking
  on what <i>she said</i>.</p>

  <p>The transformation of the last-mentioned line into&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That <i>wakes</i> her blood&mdash;look out!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>cannot, I think, be justified on any ground. He tells her something
  which "makes her blood look out." That is, something which makes her
  blush rush to the surface to look out upon it! What can be more natural?
  The proposed alteration is not only unnecessary, but awkward!</p>

  <p>In p. 499., if the words "unbraided wares" must be altered, I see no
  reason for the change to "<i>embroided</i>" wares. It seems to me that
  <i>embraided</i> would be the most proper word.</p>

  <p>What possible reason can there be for converting "force and
  knowledge," in p. 506., to "sense and knowledge?" If I may be excused a
  play upon the words, I should say the <i>sense</i> of the passage is not
  at all improved, and the <i>force</i> is entirely lost.</p>

  <p>I must protest most decidedly against the correction of the following
  lines, p. 507.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; Can he speak? hear?</p>
      <p>Know man from man? dispute his own estate?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Dispute his own estate means, <i>defend</i> his property, dispute with
  any one who questions his rights. The original passage expresses the
  sense quite perfectly, while "dispose his own estate" appears to me poor
  and insipid in comparison.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> objection to the speech of
  Camillo, in p. 514.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; it shall be so my care</p>
      <p>To have you royally appointed, as if</p>
      <p>The scene you play were mine;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>is, that to make the scene appear as if it were Camillo's, could be of
  no service to the young prince. Now Camillo says nothing about the scene
  <i>appearing</i> as his. He says he will have the prince royally
  appointed, as if the scene he played <i>were</i> really his own: that is,
  as if <i>he</i> were the party interested in it, instead of the prince.
  <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span></p>

  <p>The reading of the old corrector&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; As if</p>
      <p>The scene you play were true,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>would be nonsense; because, so far as the prince appearing to be
  Bohemia's son (which was what he was most anxious about), the scene to be
  played was <i>really true</i>!</p>

  <p>The last correction I have now to notice is in the soliloquy of
  Autolycus in p. 522.: where <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> proposes
  to read, "who knows how that may turn <i>luck</i> to my advantage,"
  instead of "may turn <i>back</i> to my advantage." I see no advantage in
  the change, but the very reverse. "Who knows but my availing myself of
  the means to do the prince my master a service, may come back to me in
  the shape of some advancement?" This seems to me to be the author's
  meaning, and it is legitimately expressed. How frequently it has been
  said that an evil deed recoils upon the head of the perpetrator! Then why
  not a good deed <i>turn back</i> to reward the doer?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cecil Harbottle.</span></p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;It is rather singular that A. E. B., who, as I have
  already shown, has so completely <i>shelved</i> me in his remarks upon
  "Aristotle's checks," should now complain of the very same thing himself,
  and say that his "humble auxilia have been coolly appropriated, without
  the slightest acknowledgment." However, as our opinions coincide upon the
  passage in question, I am not disposed to pick a quarrel with him. I
  cannot, however, at all concur in his alteration of the passage in
  <i>King Lear</i>: "Our means secure us," to "Our means <i>recuse</i> us."
  I will certainly leave him "in the quiet possession of whatever merit is
  due to this <i>restoration</i>," or rather this invention! Can A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.
  show any other instance in which Shakspeare has used the verb
  <i>recuse</i>; or will he point out any other author who has adopted it
  in the sense referred to? Johnson calls it a "juridical word:" and I
  certainly have no recollection of having met with it, except in judicial
  proceedings.</p>

  <p>I can neither subscribe to the emendation of A. E. B., nor to that of
  the old commentator, but infinitely prefer the original words, which
  appear to me perfectly intelligible. The sense, as it strikes me, is,
  that however we may desire things which we have not, the <i>means</i> we
  already possess are sufficient for our security; and even our
  <i>defects</i> prove serviceable. Blindness, for instance, will make a
  man more careful of himself; and then the other faculties he enjoys will
  secure him from harm.</p>

  <p><i>"King Lear," Act IV. Sc. 1.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Our means secure us, and our mere defects</p>
      <p>Prove our commodities."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I should not object to your correspondent A. E. B.'s conjectural
  emendation, "recuse" for "secure," but that, unless my memory and
  Ayscough are both deceptive, the word "recuse" is nowhere to be found in
  Shakspeare; nor, as far as I know, in any dramatist of the age. If it be
  used by any of the latter, it is probably only in the strict legal
  meaning, which is quite different from that which A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. would attach
  to it. This is conclusive with me; for I hold that there is no sounder
  canon in Shakspearian criticism than never to introduce by conjecture a
  word of which the poet does not himself elsewhere make use, or which is
  not at least strongly sanctioned by contemporary employment.</p>

  <p>I therefore, as the passage is flat nonsense, return to the
  well-abused "corrector's" much modester emendation, "wants" for
  "means."</p>

  <p>And now permit one word in defence of this deceased and untoward
  personage.</p>

  <p>I think much of the unpopularity into which he has fallen with a
  certain class of critics, is owing to their not allowing him fair
  play.</p>

  <p>Suppose a MS. placed in our hands, containing, beyond all doubt, what
  <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> corrected second folio is alleged
  to contain, authoritative emendations of the text: what should we, <i>à
  priori</i>, expect to find in it?</p>

  <p>That text is abominably corrupt beyond a doubt; it contains many
  impossible readings, which must be misprints or otherwise erroneous; it
  contains also many improbable readings, harsh, strained, mean,
  inadequate, and the like.</p>

  <p>Now it is excessively unlikely that a truly corrected copy, could we
  find one, would remove all the impossible readings, and leave all the
  improbable ones.</p>

  <p>It is still more unlikely that, in correcting the improbable passages,
  it would leave those to which Mr. A., or Mr. B., or Mr. C., ay, or all of
  us together, have formed an attachment from habit, predilection, or
  prejudice of some kind. Such phrases as "the blanket of the dark," "a man
  that hath had losses," "unthread the rude eye of rebellion," and many
  more, have become consecrated in our eyes by habit; they have assumed, as
  it were, the character of additions to our ordinary vocabulary; and yet I
  think sound reason itself, and that kind of secondary reason or instinct
  which long familiarity with critical pursuits gives us, combine to
  suggest that, <i>occurring in a corrupt text</i>, they are probably
  corruptions; and corruptions in lieu of some very common and even prosaic
  phrases, such as the corrector substitutes for them, and such as no
  conjectural critic would venture on.</p>

  <p>In short, the kind of disappointment which many of these corrections
  unavoidably give to the reader, is with me an argument in favour of their
  genuineness, not against it.</p>

  <p>And, lastly, in so very corrupt a text, it is <i>à priori</i> probable
  that many phrases which appear to need no correction at all, are
  misprints or <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>mistakes nevertheless. It is probably that
  the true text of the poet contained many variations utterly unimportant,
  as well as others of importance, from the printed one. Now here it is
  precisely, that we find in the corrector what we should anticipate, and
  what it is difficult to account for on any theory disparaging his
  authority. What could have induced him to make such substitutions as
  <i>swift</i> for "sweet," <i>then</i> for "there," <i>all arose</i> for
  "are arose," <i>solemn</i> for "sorry," <i>fortune</i> for "nature," to
  quote from a single play, the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, which happens to
  lie before me,&mdash;none of them necessary emendations, most of them
  trivial, unless he had under his eye some original containing those
  variations, to which he wished his own copy to conform? It is surely wild
  guessing to attribute corrections like these to a mere wanton itch for
  altering the text; and yet no other alternative is suggested by the
  corrector's enemies.</p>

  <p>I am myself as yet a sceptic in the matter, being very little disposed
  to hasty credulity on such occasions, especially where there is a
  possibility of deceit. But I must say that the doctrine of probabilities
  seems to me to furnish strong arguments in the corrector's favour; and
  that the attacks of professed Shakspearian critics on him, both in and
  out of "N. &amp; Q.," have hitherto rather tended to raise him in my
  estimation.</p>

<h3>EPITAPH AND MONUMENTS IN WINGFIELD CHURCH, SUFFOLK.</h3>

  <p>I am not aware if the following epitaph has yet appeared in print; but
  I can safely assert that it really has a sepulchral origin; unlike those
  whose doubtful character causes them to be placed by your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Mr. Shirley Hibberd</span> among the "gigantic
  gooseberries" ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 190.). I copied it myself
  from a gravestone in the churchyard of the village of Wingfield, Suffolk.
  After the name, &amp;c. of the deceased is the following verse:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Pope boldly says (some think the maxim odd),</p>
      <p>'An honest man's the noblest work of God;'</p>
      <p>If Pope's assertion be from error clear,</p>
      <p>The noblest work of God lies buried here."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Wingfield Church itself is an interesting old place, but has been a
  good deal mauled in times past; and the brasses, of which there were once
  several, are all gone. It is, I believe, a good deal noted for a parvise,
  or room over the porch, from which, by an opening in the wall, a view of
  the altar is obtained. There are two or three piscinas in different parts
  of the church, and a sedilla near the altar. The most interesting objects
  are, however, three altar tombs, with recumbent figures of the Earls of
  Suffolk; the earliest, which is of wood, representing either the first or
  second peer of the family, with his spouse. The next in date is that of
  the celebrated noble who figures in Shakspeare's <i>Henry VI.</i> The
  monument is, if I recollect right, of alabaster. The figure is attired in
  complete armour, and was originally painted; a good deal of the colour
  still remaining. This and the following monument are partly let into the
  wall, and are surmounted by beautiful Gothic canopies. The third is, I
  believe, also of alabaster, and is the effigy of (I think) the nephew of
  Margaret of Anjou's earl, and who lies by the side of his wife, one of
  Edward IV.'s family.</p>

  <p>It is very likely that all I have been writing is no news to any one.
  In that case I have but to ask your pardon for troubling you with such a
  worthless Note.</p>

  <p>* The letter of George I. is countersigned "Carteret;" those of George
  II. by "Harrington," "H. Fox," and "Bedford." None of the other letters
  in the above list bear any signature but that of the king or queen who
  wrote them. Among the letters of Henry VIII., addressed to Villiers de
  L'Isle Adam, there is one of much interest. I refer to that of the
  earliest date, in which his majesty strongly recommended the Grand Master
  to accept of Tripoli, on the coast of Barbary, and the islands of Malta
  and Gozo, as a residence for the convent, which Charles V. had offered
  him. The importance of Malta as a military station was known in England
  three hundred years ago. L'Isle Adam (with the exception of La Valetta),
  the most distinguished of all the Maltese Grand Masters, died on the 21st
  of August, 1534. The last letter of Henry VIII., addressed to him, came
  to his successor, Nicholas Cotoner. On the mantle which covered the
  remains of this great man these few words were inscribed,&mdash;"Here
  lies Virtue triumphant over Misfortune."]</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Meaning of "Clipper."</i>&mdash;I have more than once been asked
  the meaning and derivation of the term <i>clipper</i>, which has been so
  much in vogue for some years past. It is now quite a nautical term, at
  least among the fresh-water sailors: and we find it most frequently
  applied to yachts, steamers, fast-sailing merchant vessels, &amp;c. And
  in addition to the colloquial use of the word, so common in praising the
  appearance or qualities of a vessel, it has become one quite recognised
  in the official description given of their ships by merchants, &amp;c.
  Thus we often see an advertisement headed "the well-known clipper ship,"
  "the noted clipper bark," and so forth. This use of the word, however,
  and its application to <i>vessels</i>, is somewhat wide of the
  original.</p>

  <p>The word in former times meant merely a hackney, or horse adapted for
  the road. The owners of such animals naturally valued them in proportion
  to their capabilities for such service, among which great speed in
  trotting was considered one of the chief: fast trotting horses were
  eagerly sought after, and trials of speed became the fashion. A horse
  then, which was pre-eminent in this particular, was termed a
  <i>clipper</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a <i>hackney, par excellence</i>.</p>

  <p>The original of the term is perhaps the following: <i>Klepper-lehn</i>
  was a feudal tenure, so termed among the old Germans, where the yearly
  due from the vassal to the lord was a <i>klepper</i>, or, in its stead,
  so many bushels of oats: and the word <i>klepper</i>, or <i>kleopper</i>,
  is explained by Haltaus. <i>Glos. Germ. Med. Ævi</i>, 1758:</p>

  <p><i>Anathema, Maran-atha.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the following observation
  on these words may be as instructive to some of the readers of "N. &amp;
  Q." as it was to me. Maran-atha means "The Lord cometh," and is used
  apparently by St. Paul as a kind of motto: compare <span title="ho kurios engus" class="grk"
  >&#x1F41; &kappa;&#x1F7B;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
  &epsilon;&gamma;&gamma;&#x1F7B;&sigmaf;</span>, Phil. iv. 5. The Greek
  word has become blended with the Hebrew phrase, and the compound used as
  a formula of execration. (See Conybeare and Howson's <i>Life and Epistles

  suited for such an inquiry, had sat several times at St. Paul's, and made
  some progress in the business referred to them, a charter was presently
  procured to place the consideration of that matter in other hands, where
  it now remains, and will, we hope, produce excellent fruits. But whatever
  they are, they must be acknowledged to have sprung from the overtures to
  that purpose first made by the lower house of Convocation."&mdash;<i>Some

  <p>That most delightful of editors, Dr. Zachary Grey, with all his
  multifarious learning, leaves us here in the lurch for once with a simple
  reference to "Hudibras at Court," <i>Posthumous Works</i>, p. 213.</p>

  <p>Is this phrase merely an hyperbolic way of saying that pigs are very
  sharp-sighted, or is it an actual piece of folk-lore expressing a belief
  that pies have the privilege of seeing "the viewless wind?" I am inclined
  to take the latter view. Under the head of "Superstitions," in Hone's

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents inform me where the virtuous and
  patriotic William Lord Russell was buried? It is singular that neither
  Burnet, who attended him to the scaffold, nor his descendant Lord John
  Russell in writing his life, nor Collins's <i>Peerage</i>, nor the
  accounts and letters of his admirable widow, make any allusion to his
  <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>{101}</span>remains. At last I found, in the <i>State
  Trials</i>, vol. ix. p. 684., that after the executioner had held up the
  head to the people, "Mr. Sheriff ordered his Lordship's friends or
  servants to take the body and dispose of it as they pleased, being given
  them by His Majesty's favour." Probably, therefore, it was buried at
  Cheneys; but it is worth a Query to ascertain the fact.</p>

  <p>My attention was drawn to this omission by the discovery of the
  decapitated man found at Nuneham Regis ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vi., p.
  386.), and from observing that the then proprietor of the place appears
  to have been half-sister to Lady Russell, viz. daughter of the fourth
  Lord Southampton, by his second wife Frances, heiress of the Leighs,
  Lords Dunsmore, and the last of whom was created Earl of Chichester. But
  a little inquiry satisfied me this could not have been Lord Russell's
  body; among other reasons, because it was very improbable he should be
  interred at Nuneham, and because the incognito body had a peaked beard,
  whereas the prints from the picture at Woburn represent Lord Russell,
  according to the fashion of the time, without a beard.</p>

  <p>But who then was the decapitated man? He was evidently an offender of
  consequence, from his having been beheaded, and from the careful
  embalming and the three coffins in which his remains were inclosed. The
  only conjecture I see hazarded in your pages is that of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hesleden</span> (Vol. vi., p. 488.), who suggests
  Monmouth; but he has overlooked the fact stated in the original
  communication of L.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;R., that Nuneham only came into the possession
  of the Buccleuch family through the Montagues, <i>i.e.</i> by the
  marriage of Henry, third Duke of Buccleuch, to Lady Elizabeth Montagu;
  the present proprietor, Lord John Scott, being their grandson. This
  marriage took place in 1767, or eighty-two years after Monmouth's
  execution, and thirty-three years after the death of his widow, the
  Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth, who is supposed to have caused the
  body to be removed from Tower Hill.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the failure of heirs male in three noble families
  within the century, viz. the Leighs, the Wriothesleys, and the Montagus,
  the present proprietor is their direct descendant, and there are
  indications in the letter referred to, that the place of interment of his
  ancestors, as well as of this singular unknown, will no longer be
  abandoned to be a depository of farm rubbish.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT FURNITURE&mdash;PRIE-DIEU.</h3>

  <p>Perhaps some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." will be able to give me
  some information as to the use of an ancient piece of furniture which I
  have met with. At Codrington, a small village in Gloucestershire, in the
  old house once the residence of the family of that name, now a
  farm-house, they show you in the hall a piece of furniture which was
  brought there from the chapel when that part of the building was turned
  into a dairy. It is a cupboard, forming the upper part of a five-sided
  structure, which has a base projecting equally with the top, which itself
  hangs over a hollow between the cupboard and the base, and is finished
  off with pendants below the cupboard. The panel which forms the door of
  the cupboard is wider than the sides. All the panels are carved with
  sacred emblems; the vine, the instruments of the Passion, the five
  wounds, the crucifix, the Virgin and child, and a shield, with an oak
  tree with acorns, surmounted by the papal tiara and the keys. The
  dimensions are as follows:</p>

  <p>Depth from front to back, 2 feet 4½ inches.</p>

  <p>Height, 4 feet 8 inches.</p>

  <p>Height of cupboard from slab to pendants, 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

  <p>Height of base, 9½ inches.</p>

  <p>Width of side panels, 1 foot 8 inches; of centre panel, 1 foot 10½
  inches.</p>

  <p>Width of the door of the cupboard, 1 foot 5 inches.</p>

  <p>The door has carved upon it a scene representing two men, one an old
  man sitting upon a chair, the other a young one falling back from a
  stool; a table separates them and in the next compartment (for an arcade
  runs through the group) a female figure clasps her hands, as if in
  astonishment. This I can hardly understand. But the panel with the papal
  ensigns I think may throw some light on the use of the whole. In the year
  1429, John Codrington of Codrington obtained a bull from Pope Martin V.
  to have a portable altar in his house, to have mass celebrated when and
  where he pleased. I find that such a portable altar ought to have "a
  suitable frame of wood whereon to set it." Such altars are frequently
  mentioned, though I believe very few remain; but I never could hear of
  the existence of anything to show what the frame would be. It occurs to
  me as possible that this piece of furniture may have been used for the
  purpose. The whole question of portable altars is an interesting one, and
  if this account should by the means of "N. &amp; Q." fall into the hands
  of any one who is acquainted with the subject, I hope he would consider
  it worth a communication.</p>

  <p>For some time I was at a loss for another instance; however, I have
  just received from a friend, who took interest in the subject, a sketch
  of something almost identical from the disused chapel at Chillon in the
  Canton Vaud. Of this I have not the measurements, but it stands about
  breast-high. It is there called a "prie-dieu," and is said to have
  belonged to the Dukes of Savoy, but the size is very unusual for such a
  use. I send sketches of each of the subjects of my Query, <!-- Page 102
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>and hope that,
  if this should be thought worthy of a place in "N. &amp; Q.," some one
  will be able and willing to afford some information about them. I would
  add as a farther Query, the question of the meaning of the battle-axe and
  pansy, which appear on the "prie-dieu" at Chillon. Is it a known badge of
  the Savoy family?</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Reynolds' Nephew.</i>&mdash;In the Correspondence of David Garrick,
  vol. i. pp. 664. 658., 4to., 1831, there are letters of Sir Joshua
  Reynolds regarding a play written by his nephew. Can you tell me whether
  this was the Rev. Mr. Palmer, minister of the Temple Church, and who was
  afterwards Dean of Gashel; or had Sir Joshua any other nephew? The
  letters are dated 1774, and the author appears to have been resident in
  London about that time.</p>

  altercation between them, as having given occasion to some of the enemies
  of the former to tax him with Atheism? and is there any evidence, besides
  what this passage may afford, in favour of Dr. Johnson's assertion, that
  Newton <i>set out</i> as an infidel? (Boswell, July 28, 1763.) The
  <i>Optics</i> were not published till 1704, but had been composed many
  years previously.</p>

  not appear to have been known to any of our Cheshire or Lancashire

  <i>Antiquities of Bucklow Hundred</i>, Cheshire, repeatedly acknowledges
  the assistance rendered him by John Booth of Twanbow's <i>Book of

  Cheshire, and not for Lancashire. Sir George Booth, afterwards Lord
  Delamere, is the only <i>Captain</i> Booth I have met with in my limited
  sphere of historical research; and I am not aware that he ever indulged
  much in genealogical study.</p>

  <p>According to the literal meaning, it would seem that the Laird of
  Brodie was something less than a gentleman? Could his majesty intend to
  satirise the alleged royal descent of Brodie from Bruidhie, the son of
  Billi, king of the Picts (see James' <i>Critical Essay</i>), by

  of that celebrated sculptor, I have seen contradicted. She was the
  daughter of the Rev. W. Blackford, and married Mr. Henry Tighe of
  Woodstock, Ireland, in 1793. The inscription, which, I believe, is in
  existence, was not added to the monument in 1845. Can any of your

  Flaxman? Is there any authentic memoir of this delightful poetess? When
  did her husband Mr. Tighe die? He is said to have survived his lady, who
  died in 1810, but a short time; and that he was the author of a
  <i>History of the County of Kilkenny</i>. I believe it was on visiting
  the churchyard of Inistioge that Mrs. Hemans wrote "The Grave of a
  Poetess." She is said to have been very beautiful. Is there any other

<h3>ROBERT DRURY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. v., p. 533.; Vol. vii., p. 485.)</p>

  <p>Under the conviction that Robert Drury was a real character, and his
  <i>Madagascar</i> a true narrative of his shipwreck, sufferings, and
  captivity, I crave your permission to give a few additional reasons why I
  think he should be discharged from the fictitious, and admitted into the
  catalogue of real and <i>bonâ fide</i> English travellers.</p>

  <p>I have before stated that Drury did not skulk in the background when
  he published his book in 1727; but, on the contrary, invited the public
  to Tom's Coffee-house, where he engaged to satisfy the incredulous, and
  resolve the doubting. By the 3rd edition of <i>Madagascar</i>, 1743, it
  farther appears that he continued "for some years before his death" to
  resort to the above-named house; "at which place several inquisitive
  gentlemen received from his own mouth the confirmation of those
  particulars which seemed dubious, or carried with them the air of
  romance." The period was certainly unpropitious for any but a writer of
  fiction, and Drury seems to have anticipated no higher rank for his
  <i>Treatise</i>, in point of authenticity, than that occupied by the
  several members of the Robinson Crusoe school. He, however, positively
  affirms it to be "a plain honest narrative of the matter of fact;" which
  is endorsed in the following terms by "Capt. William Mackett:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is to certify, that Robert Drury, fifteen years a slave in
  Madagascar, now living in London, was redeemed from thence and brought
  into England, his native country, by myself. I esteem him an honest
  industrious man, of good reputation, and do firmly believe that the
  account he gives of his strange and surprising adventures is genuine and
  authentic."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mackett was a commander in the E. I. Comp. service; and the condenser
  of Drury's MSS., after showing the opportunities the Captain had of
  assuring himself upon the points he certifies to, characterises him as a
  well-known person, of the highest integrity and honour: a man, indeed, as
  unlikely to be imposed upon, as to be guilty of lending himself to
  others, to carry out a deception upon the public. <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Burton, in his lately published "Narratives," points out another
  source of information regarding Drury, in the <i>Gent. Mag.</i> for 1769,
  where will be found an account of W. Benbow; in this, allusion is made to
  his brother John Benbow, who was wrecked with Drury in the "Degrave"
  Indiaman, on Madagascar. W.&nbsp;D., who communicates the information to <span
  class="sc">Sylvanus Urban</span>, asserts that he recollects hearing the
  MS. Journal of this John Benbow read; and that it afforded to his mind a
  strong confirmation of the truthfulness of Drury's <i>Madagascar</i>. He
  adds the following curious particulars anent our subject:&mdash;"Robin
  Drury," he says, "among those who knew him (and he was known to many,
  being <i>a porter at the East India House</i>), had the character of a
  downright honest man, without any appearance of fraud or imposture. He
  was known to a friend of mine (now living), who frequently called upon
  him at his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, which were not then enclosed.
  He tells me he has often seen him throw a javelin there, and strike a
  small mark at a surprising distance. It is a pity," he adds, "that this
  work of Drury's is not better known, and a new edition published<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> (it having been
  long out of print); as it contains much more particular and authentic
  accounts of that large and barbarous island, than any yet given; and,
  though it is true, it is in many respects as entertaining as Gulliver or
  Crusoe."</p>

  <p>It may farther be mentioned that the French, who have a good
  acquaintance with Madagascar, "have found Drury's statement of the
  geography, the natural history, the manners of the people, and the
  conspicuous men of the time, in Madagascar, remarkably accurate."
  (<i>Bib. Gén. des Voyages</i>, Paris, 1808.) Archdeacon Wrangham says:
  "Duncombe (?) calls Drury's <i>Madagascar</i> the best and most genuine
  account ever given of the island;" and the missionary Ellis quoted Drury
  without the slightest suspicion that any doubt hangs over the genuineness
  of his narrative. Drury's account of himself runs thus:&mdash;"I, Robert
  Drury," he says, when commencing his book, "was born on July 24, 1687, in
  Crutched Friars, London, where my father then lived; but soon after
  removed to the Old Jury, near Cheapside, where he was well known, and
  esteemed for keeping that noted house called 'The King's Head,' or
  otherwise distinguished by the name of the Beef-stake House; and to which
  there was all my father's time a great resort of merchants, and gentlemen
  of the best rank and character." To this famous resort of the
  Revolutionary and Augustan ages I lately betook myself for <i>my
  stake</i>, in the hope that <i>mine host</i> might be found redolent of
  the traditional glory of his house. But alas! that worthy, although
  firmly believing in the antiquity of the King's Head, and of there being
  <i>some book</i> in existence that would prove it, could not say of his
  own knowledge whether the king originally complimented by his predecessor
  was Harry the Eighth or George the Fourth!</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I would just add, is not the circumstance of our
  subject holding the humble post of porter at the East India House
  confirmatory of that part of his story which represents him as one of the
  crew of Hon. Company's ship "Degrave," whose wreck upon Madagascar I take
  to be an undoubted fact? What so probable as this recognition, in a small

  thereto by removing him to a <i>higher shelf</i> in my library than that
  occupied by such apocryphal persons as Crusoe, Quarle, Boyle, Falconer,
  and a host of the like.</p>

<h3>THE TERMINATION -BY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 536.)</p>

  <p>I would suggest a doubt, whether the suffix <i>-by</i>, in the names
  of places, affords us any satisfactory evidence, <i>per se</i>, of their
  exclusively Danish origin. This termination is of no unfrequent
  occurrence in districts, both in this country and elsewhere, to which the
  Danes, <i>properly so called</i>, were either utter strangers, or wherein
  they at no time established any permanent footing. The truth is, there
  seems to be a fallacy in this Danish theory, in so far as it rests upon
  the testimony of language; for, upon investigation, we generally find
  that the word or phrase adduced in its support was one recognised, not in
  any single territory alone, but throughout the whole of Scandinavia,
  whose different tribes, amid some trifling variations of dialect, which
  can now be scarcely ascertained, were all of them as readily intelligible
  to one another as are, at this day, the inhabitants of two adjoining
  English counties. If this were so, it appears that, in the case before
  us, nothing can be proved from the existence of the expression, beyond
  the fact of its <i>Norse</i> origin; and our reasonable and natural
  course is, if we would arrive at its true signification, to refer at once
  to the parent tongue of the Scandinavian nations, spoken in common, and
  during a long-continued period, amid the snows of distant Iceland, on the
  mountains of Norway, the plains of Denmark, and in the forests of
  Sweden.</p>

  <p>This ancient and widely-diffused language was the Icelandic, Norman,
  or Dönsk tunga,&mdash;that in which were written the Eddas and Skálda,
  the <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>Njála and Heimskringla. In it we have the
  suffix <i>by</i>, under the forms of the verbs <i>ek bý</i>, <i>ek
  bió</i>, or <i>at búa</i>, and <i>ek byggi</i> or <i>byggia</i>, manere,
  habitare, incolere, struere, edificare; also the nouns <i>bú</i>
  (Ang.-Sax. <i>bý</i>, Dan. <i>bo</i>, <i>by</i>), domus, habitaculum; and
  <i>búi</i>, incola, colonus, vicinus; closely assimilated expressions all
  of them, in which the roots are found of our English words <i>bide</i>,
  <i>abide</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>by</i> (denoting proximity), <i>build</i>,
  <i>borough</i>, <i>bury</i> (Edmondsbury), <i>barrow</i>, <i>byre</i>,
  <i>bower</i>, <i>abode</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Now, these explanations
  undoubtedly confirm the interpretation assigned by <span class="sc">Mr.
  E.&nbsp;S. Taylor</span> to his terminating syllable; and it is probable
  enough that the villages to which he refers received their titles from
  the Danes, who, we know, on the subjugation of its former inhabitants,
  possessed themselves of the country in which they are situated. This,
  however, is a begging the question; for, resting simply on the evidence
  of the suffix, it is equally probable that these places preserved the
  names assigned to them by their former northern colonists. But our
  <i>bý</i> or <i>búa</i>, Ang.-Sax. <i>bugan</i> and <i>beón</i>, and the
  Germ. (ich) <i>bin</i> and <i>bauen</i>, have all been referred by
  learned philologists to the Greek <span title="phuô" class="grk"
  >&phi;&#x1F7B;&omega;</span>, or to <span title="bioô" class="grk"
  >&beta;&iota;&#x1F79;&omega;</span>, or to <span title="pauô, pauomai" class="grk"
  >&pi;&alpha;&#x1F7B;&omega;,
  &pi;&alpha;&#x1F7B;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>; and the word has
  affinities scattered throughout numerous languages (there are the
  Camb.-Brit. <i>bydio</i>, habitare, and <i>byw</i>, vivere, for
  instance), so that we are surrounded by difficulties, if we attempt to
  establish from its use any such point as that involved in your
  correspondent's Query.</p>

<h3>THE ROSICRUCIANS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 619.)</p>

  <p>When Pope, in dedicating his <i>Rape of the Lock</i> to Mrs. Arabella
  Fermor, was desirous of putting within the reach of that lady the
  information which <span class="sc">Mr. E.&nbsp;S. Taylor</span> has sought
  through your pages, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The <i>Rosicrucians</i> are a people that I must bring you acquainted
  with. The best account of them I know is in a French book called <i>Le
  Compte de Gabalis</i>, which, both in its title and size, is so like a
  novel, that many of the fair sex have read it for one by
  mistake."&mdash;<i>Dedicatory Letter to the Rape of the Lock.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This celebrated work was written by the Abbé Montfaucon de Villars,
  and published in 1670. "C'est une partie (says Voltaire, <i>Siècle de
  Louis XIV.</i>) de l'ancienne mythologie des Perses. L'auteur fut tué en
  1675 d'un coup de pistolet. On dit que les sylphes l'avaient assassiné
  pour avoir révélé leurs mystères." In 1680, an English translation
  appeared (<i>penes me</i>), entitled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Count of Gabalis; or the Extravagant Mysteries of the Cabalists,
  exposed in Five Pleasant Discourses on the Secret Sciences. Done into
  English by P.&nbsp;A. (Peter Ayres), Gent., with short Animadversions. London
  printed for B.&nbsp;M., printer to the Royal Society of the Sages at the Signe
  of the Rosy Crusian."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The original French work went through several editions: my own copy
  bears the imprint of <i>Amsterdam</i>, 1715, and has appended to it <i>La
  Suite du Compte de Gabalis, ou Entretiens sur les Sciences secrètes,
  touchant la nouvelle Philosophie</i>," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>So much in deference to Pope,&mdash;whose only object, however, was to
  make Mrs. Fermor acquainted with so much of Rosicrucianism as was
  necessary to the comprehension of the machinery of his poem. <span
  class="sc">Mr. E.&nbsp;S. Taylor</span> must go farther afield if he is
  desirous of "earning the <i>vere adeptus</i>," and becoming, like
  Butler's <i>Ralpho</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p>These lines enumerate, in a scarcely satirical form, the objects and
  results of a study of <i>Rosicrucianism</i>, in so far as it differs from
  that of alchemy and the occult sciences. The history of the
  <i>Rosicrucians</i>,&mdash;or rather the inquiry as to whether actually
  existed at any time such a college or brotherhood, and, if so, to what
  degree of antiquity can it lay claim,&mdash;forms another and, perhaps,
  somewhat more profitable subject of attention. This question, however,
  having been fully discussed elsewhere, I will conclude by a <i>catalogue

  readily obtainable) as will enable your correspondent to acquire for

  <p>After the slumber of a century, with new objects and regulations,
  <i>Rosicrucianism</i> (so to speak) was revived in the country of its
  birth.</p>

  <p>A very curious volume was published fifty years ago, entitled
  <i>Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of
  Europe, carried on in the secret meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati, and
  Reading Societies</i>, by John Robinson, A.M., &amp;c., 8vo., London,
  1798. This volume is chiefly occupied by a history of the origin,
  proceedings, and objects of the <i>Illuminati</i>, a sect which had
  rendered important services to revolutionary interests, and laid the
  foundations of European propagandism. Much curious matter relative to
  this sect will also be found in George Sand's <i>Comtesse de
  Rudolstadt</i>, vol. ii.; upon, or just before, its extinction, a new
  political association was formed at Baden and Carlsruhe, under the
  auspices of Baron van Edelsheim, police minister of the Elector, under
  the title of <i>Die Rosenkrietzer</i>. This society was called into
  existence by a reactionary dread of that republicanism in politics, and
  atheism in morals, which seemed at that time to prey upon the vitals of
  European society. The society soon spread, and had its affiliations in
  various parts of Germany, giving such uneasiness to Buonaparte, to the
  accomplishment of whose projects it exercised an adverse influence, that
  he despatched a secret messenger for the purpose of obtaining information
  as to its projects and developments. He did everything in his power to
  destroy the association, which, however, survived, until his murder of
  Palm, the bookseller, for publishing the <i>Geist der Zeit</i>, seeming
  to call for a new and modified association, led to its extinction, and
  the creation of a new secret society, the celebrated <i>Tungen-Bund</i>,
  in its place.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that in the foregoing I have confined myself to that
  part of your correspondent's Query which relates to "the Brethren of the
  Rosy-Cross." I have not ventured to allude to the Alchymists, or the
  writings of Paracelsus, his predecessors and followers, which form a
  library, and demand a catalogue for their mere enumeration. If <span
  class="sc">Mr. E.&nbsp;S. Taylor</span>, however, is desirous of farther
  information, and will favour me with his address, I shall be happy to
  assist his researches in Hermetic philosophy to the extent of my
  ability.</p>

  <p class="address">Birmingham.</p>

  <p>The Society of Rosicrucians, or Rosecroix (whom Collier calls a sect
  of mountebanks), first started into existence in Germany in the
  seventeenth century. They laid claim to the possession of divers secrets,
  among which the philosopher's stone was the least. They never dared to
  appear publicly, and styled themselves <i>The Invisible</i>. <!-- Page
  108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span></p>

  <p>In 1622 they put forth the following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We, deputed by our College, the principal of the brethren of the
  Rosicrucians, to make our visible and invisible abode in this city,
  through the grace of the Most High; towards whom are turned the hearts of
  the just: we teach without books or notes, and speak the languages of the
  countries wherever we are, to draw men like ourselves from the error of
  death."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Illuminati of Spain were a branch of this sect. In 1615 one John
  Bringeret printed a work in Germany containing two treatises, entitled
  <i>The Manifesto and Confession of Faith of the Fraternity of the
  Rosicrucians in Germany</i>.</p>

<h3>WAS COOK THE DISCOVERER OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS?</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 6.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Warden</span> will find this question discussed
  by La Pérouse (English 8vo. edit., vol. ii. ch. 6.), who concludes
  unhesitatingly that the Sandwich group is identical with a cluster of
  islands discovered by the Spanish navigator Gaetan in 1542, and by him
  named "The King's Islands." These the Spaniard placed in the tenth,
  although the Sandwich Islands are near the twentieth, degree of north
  latitude, which La Pérouse believed was a mere clerical error. The
  difference in longitude, sixteen or seventeen degrees, he ascribed to the
  imperfect means of determination possessed by the early navigators, and
  to their ignorance of the currents of the Pacific.</p>

  <p>Allowing for the mistake in latitude, the King's Islands are evidently
  the same as those found on some old charts, about the nineteenth and
  twentieth degrees of north latitude, under the names of <i>La Mesa</i>,
  <i>Los Mayos</i>, and <i>La Disgraciada</i>; which Capt. Dixon, as well
  as La Pérouse, sought for in vain in the longitude assigned to them. They
  appear to have been introduced into the <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>English and French
  charts from that found in the galleon taken by Commodore Anson, and of
  which a copy is given in the account of his voyage. Cook, or Lieutenant
  Roberts, the compiler of the charts to his third voyage, retained them;
  and La Pérouse was the first to erase them from the map. There can,
  indeed, be little doubt of their identity with the Sandwich Islands. But
  although Cook was not actually the first European who had visited those
  islands, to him rightly belongs all the glory of their discovery.
  Forgotten by the Spaniards, misplaced on the chart a thousand miles too
  far to the eastward, and unapproached for 240 years, their existence
  utterly unknown and unsuspected, Cook was, to all intents and purposes,
  their real discoverer.</p>

  that no British naturalist "of any mark or likelihood," has ever assumed
  that (though undoubtedly sloths) either the <i>Mylodon</i>,
  <i>Scelidotherium</i>, or <i>Megatherium</i>, were climbers. Indeed, the
  whole osseous structure of those animals proves that they were formed to
  uprend the trees that gave them sustenance. By no other hypothesis can we
  intelligibly account for the immense expanse of pelvis, the great bulk of
  hind-legs, the solid tail, the massive anterior limbs furnished with such
  powerful claws, and the extraordinary large spinal chord&mdash;all these
  the characteristic features of the <i>Mylodon</i>.</p>

  <p>Whether there were palms or not at the period of the telluric
  formation, I cannot undertake to say; but as <span class="sc">A Foreign
  Surgeon</span> assumes that a palm is an exogenous tree (!), I am induced
  to suspect that his acquaintance with geology may be equally as limited
  as his knowledge of botany. Besides, what can he mean by speaking of a
  sloth "the size of a large bear?" Why, the <i>Mylodon</i> must have been
  larger than a rhinoceros or hippopotamus. The veriest tyro in natural
  history would see that at the first glance of the massive skeleton.</p>

  <p>It is a painful and ungracious task to have to pen these observations,
  especially, too, in the case of a stranger. But "N. &amp; Q." must not be
  made a channel for erroneous statements, and we "natives and to the
  manner born" must be allowed to know best what is in our own museums.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;Like many of your correspondents, I
  have been an inquirer on the subject of stereoscopic angles, which seems
  to be still a problem for solution. What is this problem? for until that
  be known, we cannot hope for a solution. I would ask, is it
  this?&mdash;<i>Stereoscopic pictures should create in the mind precisely
  such a conception as the two eyes would if viewing the object represented
  by the stereograph.</i> If this be the problem (and I cannot conceive
  otherwise), its solution is simple enough, as it consists in placing the
  cameras <i>invariably</i> 2½ inches apart, on a line parallel to the
  building, or a plane passing through such a figure as a statue, &amp;c.
  In this mode of treatment we should have two pictures possessing like
  stereosity with those on the retinas, and consequently with like result
  and as our eyes enable us to conceive perfectly of any solid figure, so
  would the stereograph. I believe, therefore, that this is, under every
  circumstance, the correct treatment; simply because every other mode may
  be proved to be false to nature.</p>

  <p>Professor Wheatstone recommends 1 in 25 when objects are more than 50
  feet distant, and this rule seems to be pretty generally followed. Its
  incorrectness admits of easy demonstration. Suppose a wall 300 feet in
  extent, with abutments, each two feet in front, and projecting two feet
  from the wall, at intervals of five feet. The proper distance from the
  observer ought to be 450 feet, which, agreeably with this rule, would
  require a space of 18 feet between the cameras. Under this treatment the
  result would be, that both of the <i>sides, as well as the fronts</i>, of
  the three central abutments would be seen; whilst of all the rest, only
  the front and one side would be visible. This would be outraging nature,
  and false, and therefore should, I believe, be rejected. The eyes of an
  observer situated midway between the cameras, could not possibly perceive
  either of the sides of the buttress opposite to him, and only the side
  next to him of the rest. This seems to me conclusive.</p>

  <p>Again, your correspondent <span class="grk">&Phi;</span>. (Vol. vii.,
  p. 16.) says, that for portraits he finds 1 in 10 a good rule. Let the
  sitter hold, straight from the front, <i>i.e.</i> in the centre, a box 2½
  inches in width. The result would be, that in the stereographs the box
  would have both its sides represented, and the front, instead of being
  horizontal, consisting of two inclined lines, <i>i.e.</i> unless the
  cameras were <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>placed on <i>one line</i>, when it would
  be horizontal. In such treatment the departure from both is as great as
  in the first example, and the outrage greater, inasmuch as, under these
  circumstances (I mean a boy with a box), to any person of common sense,
  the caricature would be at a glance obvious. This rule, then, although it
  produces stereosity enough, being false, should also be rejected.</p>

  <p>I believe that 2½ inches will be found to be right under any
  circumstance; but should sufficient reasons be offered for a better rule,
  I trust I am open to conviction, and shall hail with great pleasure a
  demonstration of its correctness.</p>

  <p>Should it, however, turn out that I have given a right definition, and
  a correct solution of this most interesting problem, I shall rejoice to
  know that I have rendered an essential service to a great number of
  anxious students in photography.</p>

  <p><i>Yellow Bottles for Photographic Chemicals.</i>&mdash;The proposal
  of your correspondent <span class="sc">Ceridwen</span> to employ yellow
  glass bottles for preventing the decomposition of photographic solutions
  has been anticipated. It was suggested by me, in some lectures on
  Photography in November 1847, and in January of the present year, that
  yellow bottles might be so used, as well as for preventing the
  decomposition, by light, of the vegetable substances used in pharmacy,
  such as digitalis, ipecacuanha, cinchona, &amp;c. For solutions of
  silver, however, the most effectual remedy against precipitation is the
  use of very pure water, procured by slow redistillation in glass vessels
  at a temperature much below the boiling point.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Earth upon Earth, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;I think the information which
  has been elicited in connexion with the so-called "Unpublished Epigram by
  Sir W. Scott," "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 498., sufficiently curious to
  justify an additional reference to the sentiment in question; the more so
  as I have to mention the name of its putative author. In Montgomery's
  <i>Christian Poet</i>, 3rd edit. p. 58., he gives, under the title of
  "Earth upon Earth," five verses, which it would appear are substantially
  the same as those published by Weaver (whose <i>Funeral Monuments</i>,
  his only publication, I have not within reach), but they exhibit
  considerable verbal difference in the verses corresponding with those
  cited in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 576. Montgomery tells us in a note
  that this extract, given under the name of William Billyng, along with
  another from a poem entitled "The Five Wounds of Christ," by the same
  author, were from "a manuscript on parchment of great antiquity, in
  possession of William Bateman, Esq.," of which a few copies had been
  printed at Manchester, and "accompanied by rude but exceedingly curious
  cuts." Now who was William Billyng? And when did he live? Montgomery says
  "the age of this author is well known." The death of the Archbishop of
  Canterbury, to whom Weaver (<i>Fun. Mon.</i> 1631) applies the Stratford
  epigraph, is temp. Edward III. Is Mr. Bateman's MS. in a hand indicating
  so early a date?</p>

  <p><i>Picalyly</i> (Vol. viii., p. 8.).&mdash;In Barnaby Rich's
  <i>Honestie of this Age</i>, p. 37. of the Percy Society reprint, we find
  this passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But he that some fortie or fifty yeares sithens should haue asked
  after a Pickadilly, I wonder who could haue understood him, or could haue
  told what a Pickadilly had beene, either fish or flesh."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Little did the writer think that in future years the name would become
  a "household word;" though his prophecy as to the meaning of the word has
  been fulfilled by the appearance of the Query in the pages of "N. &amp;
  Q."</p>

  <p>The editor of the work, Mr. Peter Cunningham, has a long note on the
  above passage; and I am indebted to him for the following.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ben Jonson (<i>Works</i> by Gifford, viii. 370.) speaks of a
  <i>picardill</i> as a new cut of band much in fashion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ready to cast at one whose band stands still,</p>
      <p>And then leap mad on a neat <i>picardill</i>.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"But Middleton, <i>The World tost at Tennis</i>, 1620, speaks of a
  <i>pickadill</i> in connexion with the shears, the needle, &amp;c. of the
  tailor; from which it appears to have been an instrument used for
  plaiting the picked vandyke collar worn in those days.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gifford, in a note on another passage in Ben Jonson, says:</p>

  <p>'<i>Picardil</i> is simply a diminutive of <i>picca</i> (Span. and
  Ital.), a spear-head; and was given to this article of foppery from a
  fancied resemblance of its stiffened plaits to the bristled points of
  these weapons. Blount thinks, and apparently with justice, that
  <i>Picadilly</i> took its name frown the sale of the 'small stiff collars
  so called,' which was first set on foot in a house near the western
  [eastern] extremity of the present street by one Higgins, a tailor.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The bands worn by the clergy and judges, &amp;c., at the present day,
  are lineal descendants of the old <i>picadils</i>, reduced to a more
  sober cut; and the picked ornament alluded to by your correspondent no
  doubt derived its name from its resemblance in shape to these tokens of
  ancient fashion.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Justice Newton</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 528. 600.; Vol. viii., p.

  Lenthall's</span> first Query, because it was <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>palpable, from the
  context, that the "Mr. Justice Newton" he inquired after could not
  possibly be the Chief Justice who flourished in the fifteenth century;
  and because I am not aware of any judge of the superior courts of that
  name, during the time of the Commonwealth, or the years which immediately
  preceded or followed that period. Indeed, his designation as "Mr. Justice
  Newton, <i>of the Middle Temple</i>," plainly proves that he could not
  have been a judge upon the Bench at Westminster. He may perhaps have been
  a Welsh judge; or, remembering that "Mr. Justice" was the common title
  for a Justice of the Peace, it is still more probable that he was merely
  a magistrate of the county in which he resided.</p>

  <p><i>Manners of the Irish</i> (Vol. viii., p. 5.).&mdash;In the very
  curious extract given by your correspondent H., <i>boyranne</i> is very
  likely to stand for <i>borbhan</i>, the Irish for "lamentation" or
  "complaint." An Irish landlord knows full well that, even up to the
  present day, his tenants "keep the bread, and make <i>borbhan</i>."
  <i>Molchan</i>, I suspect, comes from <i>miolc</i>, whey. <i>Localran</i>
  stands for <i>loisgrean</i>, corn turned out of the ear. As to the
  concluding line of the extract, I must leave it to some better Irish
  scholar than I can boast myself.</p>

  <p><i>Arms of the See of York</i> (Vol. viii., p. 34.).&mdash;I was about
  to send a note to "N. &amp; Q.," pointing out that Mr. Knight, in his
  heraldic illustrations to 2 <i>Hen. IV.</i>, in his <i>Pictorial Edition
  of Shakspeare</i>, has given the modern bearings of the see of York to
  Archbishop Scroope, instead of those which belonged to that date, when I
  observed a Query from <span class="sc">Tee Bee</span>, asking the date
  and origin of the <i>change</i> of arms which took place. I am sorry that
  I am unable to give any authority for my statement, but I believe it to
  be not the less true, that the change in question took place when
  Cardinal Wolsey came to the see. Nor can I give any farther reason for
  that change than the notorious jealousy of the Cardinal towards the
  superior rank of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Up to this period the arms
  of the two sees were precisely the same, though <span class="sc">Tee
  Bee</span> gives the number of crosses "patée fitchée" on the pall for
  difference; I should be glad to know whether there is good authority for
  this statement. The present arms of the see evidently have reference to
  the dedication of the ancient cathedral church to St. Peter.</p>

  <p><i>"Up, Guards, and at 'em!"</i> (Vol. v., p. 426.).&mdash;These
  oft-quoted words have already engaged the attention of the readers of "N.
  &amp; Q." Your frequent correspondent C. (Vol. v., p. 426.) is of opinion
  that the Duke <i>did</i> make use of these, or equivalent, words. The
  following extract I have copied from an article in the June number of
  <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>. It will be found at p. 700. as a foot-note
  to a clever article, one of a series, entitled "Random Recollections of
  Campaigns under the Duke of Wellington," written by an officer of the
  second brigade of Guards.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The expression attributed to the Duke of 'Up, guards, and at them
  again!' I have good reason for <i>knowing</i> was never made use of by
  him. He was not even <i>with</i> the brigade of Guards in question at the
  <i>time</i> they rose from their recumbent position to attack the French
  column in their front, and therefore could not well have thus addressed
  them. I never heard this story till long after, on my return to England,
  when it was related by a lady at a dinner-table; probably it was the
  invention of some goodly Botherby. I remember denying my belief at the
  time, and my view has since been sufficiently confirmed. Besides, the
  words bear no internal evidence of the style either of thought or even
  expression of him to whom they were attributed."</p>

  of Maginn's life, in a new and well-conducted periodical, <i>The Irish
  Quarterly Review</i>, which, in the number for September, 1852, after
  giving a most humorous account of a first interview between Blackwood and
  his wild Irish contributor, who had for more than a year been mystifying
  the editor by contributions under various signatures, proceeds
  thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A few days before the first interview with Blackwood, Maginn had sent

  <p>It was having read the Memoir in <i>The Irish Quarterly</i> which

  <p><i>Mitigation of Capital Punishment</i> (Vol. viii., p. 42.).&mdash;I

  accompaniments" as an imputation on himself. I did not intend it for one,
  having no doubt that he repeated the story as he heard it. In it were two
  statements of the highest decree of improbability. One I showed (Vol. v.,
  p. 434.) to be contrary to penal, the other to forensic practice. One
  <span class="sc">Mr. Gatty</span> found to have been only a report, the
  other to have occurred at a different place and under different
  circumstances. Had these been stated in the first version, I should not
  have disputed them. Whittington was thrice Lord Mayor of
  London&mdash;that is history, to which the prophecy of Bow-bells and the
  exportation of the cat are "mythic accompaniments."</p>

  <p><i>The Man with the Iron Mask</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 234. 344.).&mdash;I
  think that Mr. James, in his <i>Life and Times of Louis XIV.</i>, has, to
  say the least, shown strong grounds for doubting the theory which
  identifies this person with Mathioli; and since then several writers have
  been inclined to fall back, in the want of any more probable explanation,
  on the old idea that the captive was a twin brother of Louis. What has
  become of the letter from M. de St. Mars, said to have been discovered
  some years ago, confirming this last hypothesis? Has any such letter been
  published, and, if so, what is the opinion of its genuineness?</p>

  <p><i>Gentleman executed for Murder of a Slave</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  of Barbadoes, a slaveowner, having killed one of his own slaves, was
  tried for the murder and acquitted, the law considering that such an act
  was not murder. Thereupon Lord Seaforth came to England, obtained an act
  of parliament declaring the killing of a slave to be murder, and returned
  to Barbadoes to resume his official duties. Soon afterwards another slave
  was killed by his owner, who was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be
  hanged for murder under the new act of parliament. At the time appointed
  the prisoner was brought out for execution, but so strong was public
  feeling, that the ordinary executioner was not forthcoming; and on the
  governor requiring the sheriff to perform his office either in person or
  by deputy, after some excuses he absolutely refused. The governor then
  addressed the guard of soldiers, desiring a volunteer for executioner,
  adding, "whoever would volunteer should be subsequently protected as well
  as rewarded then." One presented himself, and it thenceforth became as
  dangerous to kill a slave as a freeman in Barbadoes.</p>

  <p><i>Character of the Song of the Nightingale</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  397.).&mdash;I imagine that many of the writers quoted by your
  correspondent lived in places too far removed to the north or west (as is
  my own case) ever to have heard the nightingale, and are, in consequence,
  not competent authorities as to a song they can only have described at
  second hand; but that Shelley was not far wrong in styling it voluptuous,
  and placing it amidst the luxurious bowers of Daphne, may receive some
  confirmation from an anecdote told by Nimrod ("Life and Times,"
  <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, vol. xxv. p. 301.) of the sad effects produced
  both on morals and parish rates by the visit of a nightingale one summer
  to the groves of Erthig, near Wrexham.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden.</span></p>

  <p>I accidently met with a scrap of evidence on this point lately, as I
  was driving at midnight on a sudden call to visit a dying man. The
  nightingales were singing in full choir, when my servant, an intelligent
  young man from the country, remarked, "A cheerful little bird the
  nightingale, Sir. It is beautiful to hear them singing when one is
  walking alone on a dark night."</p>

  <p>Unsophisticated judgment of this sort, when met with unsought, seems

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Cuthbert Bede</span> gives, in his list of

  Graingle. How the last two employ the term I do not know, perhaps they
  <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>{113}</span>copied from Milton; but he uses it, not as
  an epithet exactly, but to express the frequency of the bird's
  appearance. "Night, her <i>solemn</i> bird," means the <i>customary</i>
  attendant of the night: <i>solemn</i> being used in the classical sense,
  and derived front <i>soles</i>. So Virgil, "Solemnes tum forte dapes et
  tristia dona ante urbem in luco," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The word <i>solemn</i> probably acquired its present signification
  from the staid manner in which Englishmen go through their customary
  ceremonies. "They took their pleasure <i>sadly</i>," as Froissart has

  <p><i>Mysterious Personage</i> (Vol. viii., p. 34.).&mdash;There is no

  Duke of Modena, lineally descended from Henrietta of England, youngest
  daughter of Charles I.: she married Philip Duke of Orleans, son of Louis
  XIII. and Anne of Austria, and had two daughters; Louisa married to
  Charles II. of Spain (she died without issue), and Anna Maria, married to
  Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy and King of Sardinia. Their son Charles
  Emanuel III. succeeded in 1730, and was succeeded by his son Victor
  Amadeus III. He was succeeded by his eldest son Charles Emanuel IV., who
  died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother Victor Emanuel, who
  left twin daughters, the elder of whom, Mary Beatrice, married Francis
  Duke of Modena, while the crown of Sardinia passed to her father's heirs
  male. The Duchess Mary Beatrice of Modena has left two sons, the elder of
  whom (born June 14, 1819) is the direct, undoubted heir of the House of

  book is so excellent, and the prayers so warm and Ken-like, that its

  Subsequently to the publication of this collection, it was ascertained
  that the prayers and other parts of <i>The Crown of Glory</i> were taken

  <p><i>Pennycomequick, adjoining Plymouth</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  8.).&mdash;In days gone by, when the boundaries of the town were much
  more circumscribed than at the present day, a well-known old female (a
  perfect character in her way) had long fixed her abode in a curiously
  built hut-like cot in the locality in question; the rusticity of which,
  together with the obliging demeanour of its tenants, had gradually
  induced the good folk of Plymouth to make holiday bouts to this retired
  spot for the purpose of merry-making. As years rolled on, the shrewd old
  dame became a general favourite with the pleasure-seekers; the increasing
  frequency of these pic-nics suggesting to her an opportunity which might
  be turned to good account, viz. that of providing her visitors with the
  cheap requisite, boiling water, for the brewing their sober afternoon's
  beverage, at the low rate of a penny a head. Still later in the evening
  of life, shrugging herself closely in her old scarlet cloak, which had
  served her well for better than half a century, she would, with much
  apparent gusto, recount to her pleased auditory how many a time and often
  she had made the "penny come quick," by the above-recited inexpensive
  vocation; until at length her saying became a by-word in the
  neighbourhood, and universal consent fixed on the ever-happy
  octogenarian's triplet as a fitting appellation for the then nameless and
  retired little nook, but now thickly studded grounds, of
  <i>Pennycomequick</i>.</p>

  <p>That equally simple occurrences have frequently given rise to the
  names of places, is shown by other remarkable titles of localities not
  far distant from <i>Pennycomequick</i>, such as those of "The Bold
  Venture," and of "No Place."</p>

  <p><i>Sir G. Browne, Bart.</i> (Vol. vii., p. 528.)&mdash;Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Newbury</span> is in error in styling this
  George Browne a baronet, nor was he of West Stafford or Wickham. He was
  the sole son and heir of Sir George Browne, Knight, of Wickhambreux, co.
  Kent, Caversham, co. Oxford, and Cowdray in Midhurst, co. Sussex; which
  last estate devolved on this family by the will of William Fitzwilliam,
  Earl of Southampton, the son of Lucy (daughter and co-heiress of John
  Nevill, Marquess of Montagu) by her first husband, Sir Thomas Fitzwillam
  of Aldwark, co. York; which Lucy became the wife of Sir Anthony Browne,
  who was knighted at the battle of Stoke, June 6, 1487, and succeeded as
  above-mentioned to the Cowdray estate.</p>

  <p>George Browne, who married Elizabeth or Eleanor, the daughter of Sir
  Richard Blount, was of Wickhambreux, Caversham, and also of West Shefford
  in co. Berks; his name appears as thus in the Visitation of this county
  anno 1623. Of the nineteen children, he had three sons whose names are
  not given, and who died in the Royal cause during the civil wars: but as
  Richard, the third son, is expressly mentioned, he certainly was not one
  of the three killed in the service of King Charles I. Sir George Browne,
  second, but eldest surviving son, was made a K.B. at the coronation of
  King Charles II.; and was celebrated by Pope in his "Windsor Forest." He
  married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Englefield, the second baronet
  of Wootton Bassett, co. Wilts, and died <i>s. p. m.</i> George, the
  eldest born, died an infant. Henry, the fourth son, died unmarried March
  19, 1668, and was buried at West Shefford; and John, the fifth son, was
  of Caversham, and created a baronet May 19, 1665. He married the widow of
  &mdash;&mdash; Bradley, and was the ancestor of the baronets of
  Caversham, extinct in 1774. Three daughters, whose names are not given,
  became nuns. Eleanor, another daughter, died unmarried, Nov. 27, 1662,
  and was buried at West Shefford: and Elizabeth was the wife of John Yate
  of West Hanney, co. Berks; and who died Jan. 26, 1671, before his
  wife.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,

  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
